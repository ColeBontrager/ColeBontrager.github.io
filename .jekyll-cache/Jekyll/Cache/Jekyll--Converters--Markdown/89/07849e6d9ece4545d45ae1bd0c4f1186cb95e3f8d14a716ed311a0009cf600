<p>Possession Obsession is a competitive local multiplayer game slated for release in spring 2022. In the game, players work against each other by using their abilities as a spirit and possessing humans to complete tasks for the devil and earn points. Possession Obsession had been in development for a year when I joined to team. It has been a valuable experience working with and expanding on an existing codebase for a game. Since joining, I have been responsible for designing the implementation of the scoring, round, and task systems which faciliate gameplay. I have also implemented functionality for the tasks themselves including the delivery and keep away tasks seen in the gameplay above.</p>
