<p>Possession Obsession is a competitive local multiplayer game slated for release in spring 2022. In the game, players work against each other by using their abilities as a spirit and possessing humans to complete tasks for the devil and earn points. Possession Obsession had been in development for a year when I joined to team. Since joining, I have been responsible for designing the implementation of the scoring, round, and task systems which faciliate gameplay. I implemented the UI between rounds, including an animated graph that shows the playersâ€™ scores over time during the round. I implemented the control points task in which players fight for control over an area by being the only one possessing an npc within the control point.</p>
